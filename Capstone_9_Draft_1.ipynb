    "### Introduction: Business Problem \n",
    "The purpose of this project is to identifiy which public high school's within the five boroughs that make up the New York City area have the highest overall SAT scores, while isolating the public high school's that received the highest score for each section (math, reading, writing) of the SAT test and through k-mean clustering locate which borough has the highest performing public high schools. \n",
    "\n",
    "This report will be targeted to people who are looking to relocate or trying to apply to New York City area public high schools with the highest performing SAT scores. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Data \n",
    "Concentrating on the stated business problem, factors that will influence the location of high schoosl are:\n",
    "\n",
    "The SAT score averages that have been provided by the College Board in each of the five boroughs creating the New York City area during the years 2014-2015.\n",
    "\n",
    "The high school data that has been compiled and published by the New York City Department of Education.\n",
    "\n",
    "Following data sources will be needed to extract/generate the required information:\n",
    "\n",
    "Part 1: Preprocessing the average SAT 2014-2015 school year SAT test scores data from Kaggle. Crafting a datafram illustrating the avaerage SAT scores for every accredited high school in the New York City, five borough area. \n",
    "\n",
    "Part 2: Generate a map of the public high schools with the highest average total SAT test scores and three main sections of the test within the five boroughs area of New York City via folium.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Part 3: Identify the closest venders to the public high schools with the highest SAT test scores with the 5 borough New York City area, via FourSquare API and geocoding."

    "#### Results:\n",
    "Stuyvesant High School located in Manhatten was the top performing average SAT test score in all sections of the SAT test. The same ten high schools were listed for each section of test and subsequently, had the highest total average test scores as well. Those schools are:Stuyvesant High School, Staten Island Technical High School, Bronx High School of Science, High School of American Studies at Lehman College, Townsend Harris High School, Queens High School for the Sciences at York College, Bard High School Early College, Brooklyn Technical High School, Eleanor Roosevelt High School, High School for Mathematics, Science, and Engineering at City College.\n",

    "\n",
    "#### Discussion:\n",
    "The aim of this project is to help families and students identify public high schools within the New York City, five boroughs area with the highest average SAT test scores. xpats can chose the neighborhoods to which they want to relocate based on the most common SAT test scores are used help colleges interpret students' overall academic performance in relation to the national applicant pool. For families and students that are planning for college admission after high school, the public high schools with the total highest test scores are of interest. Additionlly, if a student is weak in one section of the test, a public high school that has high average test scores within this academic disapline is of intersest as well.  Lastly, identifing the closest local vendors to the highest total average test score public high school assisst family with planning for after school activities, pick-up/drop-off locations, and an overall general idea of what is within walking distance of the school. \n",

    "## Conclusion:\n",
    "This project aids families and students alike with a better understanding of public high schools with high academic achievements with respect to the SAT test scores. Venues near the public high schools aslo allow families and students to find local, walking distance places near the public high schools for planning purposes and neighborhood associations. Reconizing that this project was singularly focused on SAT test scores, future projects could use this data as a platform for more indepth analysis of public high schools located within the New York City, five boroughs area.
